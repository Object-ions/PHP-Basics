## Challenge 2

1. Create a class called `StringUtility` that has the following static methods:

- `shout($string)` - Takes in a string and returns it in all uppercase letters with an exclamation mark added to the end.

- `whisper($string)` - Takes in a string and returns it in all lowercase letters with a period added to the end.

- `repeat($string, $times)` - Takes in a string and a number and returns the string repeated the specified number of times. Use a default value of `2` for the `$times` parameter.

2. Create a new instance of the `StringUtility` class and call each of the methods on it.

#### Hints

- You can use the `strtoupper` and `strtolower` functions to convert a string to uppercase or lowercase.
- You can use the `str_repeat` function to repeat a string a certain number of times.
